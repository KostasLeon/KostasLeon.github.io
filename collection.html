          <li>Stari Most (English: Old Bridge) is a 16th-century Ottoman bridge in the city of Mostar in Bosnia and Herzegovina
						that crosses the river Neretva and connects the two parts of the city. The Old Bridge stood for 427 years, until it was
						destroyed on 9 November 1993 by Croat forces during the Croat and Bosniak War. Subsequently,
					 a project was set in motion to reconstruct it, and the rebuilt bridge opened on 23 July 2004.</li>
