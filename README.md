I had many difficult with the assignment.First of all was the static form on the contact, i search for hours to achieve this but i am a
ittle bit disappointed because its not like i wanted.I	have a hard time on the css because i wanted the color to the links to be orange 
but i finally did it.Another problem i had it was with the pictures i wanted them on a 	specifically place i had to do some tutorials on 
W3Schools to do this.On the cv page i could make the sentence to go down to the other one.My friend Vaggelis and I done some meeting tp
help me with some of my problems and i help him to,this was a good desicion from us to do a meeting.I started the assignment on 12 December,
but i wasn't hurry.I don't know specifically how many hours i had worked for the  assignment but i know that i have lear some thinks 
that before i didn't.
